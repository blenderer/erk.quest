In 2009, I was too busy playing [World of Warcraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xRjXcM_cb4) and League of Legends to care that my first website was being deleted from [Geocities](https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/yahoo-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities-idUSTRE53M5LH/).

[http://www.geocities.com/wrestlenovi](http://www.geocities.com/wrestlenovi) - My deleted dragonball tabletop rpg fansite

I've had SIXTEEN years to stew on this tragedy, but here I am wishing I could have archived the website myself

Anyway, here I am wishing to capture some of the magic of Geocities in a world which has transcended "websites".

My goals for this place:

1. A place to write about navigating life as an human
2. A place to archive my gameplay
